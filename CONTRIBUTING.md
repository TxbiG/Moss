# Contributing to Moss Framework

Thank you for considering contributing to Moss Framework! 🌿 

Even though I’m currently the only developer, contributions from the community are welcome and appreciated. Whether it’s bug reports, small fixes, documentation improvements, or example projects, every contribution helps make the framework stronger.

>These guidelines are here to help you understand how to contribute efficiently and respectfully.

## Ways you can help
Even as a one-person project, you can contribute in many ways: 
- Bug reports & fixes – Let me know if you find a crash, rendering glitch, or performance issue. If you can provide a fix, even better!
- Documentation improvements – Tutorials, API clarifications, README updates, or example projects are very welcome. 
- Examples – Share small demos to showcase how to use Moss Framework. Performance testing – Run benchmarks, profile, and suggest optimizations. 

>Small contributions matter. Fixing typos, cleaning up code, or adding minor helpers are appreciated.

## What I don’t accept 
- To avoid confusion: 
    - Issues that are purely support questions. 
    - Pull requests that break core platform compatibility.
    - Changes that don’t follow the code style or testing guidelines.

## Reporting a bug 
Before reporting, check if the bug exists in the latest version. 

- Moss Framework version 
- Platform & architecture (Windows/Linux/MacOS, x86/ARM) 
- Steps to reproduce the issue 
- Expected behavior 
- Actual behavior 

## Suggesting features 
Open an issue describing why the feature is needed and how it might work. Check if similar features already exist. Keep suggestions aligned with Moss Framework’s philosophy: modular, cross-platform, high-performance, and lightweight.
