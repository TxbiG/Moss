# Contributing to Moss Framework

Thank you for considering contributing to Moss Framework! 🌿 

Even though I’m currently the only developer, contributions from the community are welcome and appreciated. Whether it’s bug reports, small fixes, documentation improvements, or example projects, every contribution helps make the framework stronger.

>These guidelines are here to help you understand how to contribute efficiently and respectfully.

## Ways you can help
Even as a one-person project, you can contribute in many ways: 
- Bug reports & fixes – Let me know if you find a crash, rendering glitch, or performance issue. If you can provide a fix, even better!
- Documentation improvements – Tutorials, API clarifications, README updates, or example projects are very welcome. 
- Examples – Share small demos to showcase how to use Moss Framework. Performance testing – Run benchmarks, profile, and suggest optimizations. 

>Small contributions matter. Fixing typos, cleaning up code, or adding minor helpers are appreciated.

## What I don’t accept 
- To avoid confusion: 
    - Issues that are purely support questions. 
    - Pull requests that break core platform compatibility.
    - Changes that don’t follow the code style or testing guidelines.

## Ground rules 
We value respectful collaboration and high-quality contributions: Test all changes on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android) if possible. Follow our coding standards (C++17, consistent formatting, modular code). Keep new features focused and incremental. Document your changes clearly in code and README/examples. Be welcoming to all contributors and encourage diverse participation. Follow the Moss Framework Code of Conduct

## Your first contribution 
New contributors are welcome! Start by looking at: docs – improve guides or tutorials examples – add simple demo projects test – help with unit and integration tests Beginner-friendly issues are labeled as good first issue. For help understanding Git, GitHub, or making your first pull request, these are great resources: Make a Pull Request First Timers Only
